Places: Template f√ºr Wordpress
==============================

`Places` is a theme for Wordpress. It's based on `_s`, or [`underscores`](http://underscores.me/).

The theme is ajax enabled and thought for mapping projects. It uses leaflet library to show locations on a OpenStreetMap and intends to stay always with the same map as background.

## Custom post type `place`

All registers of this post type are drawn by the template on the map. The only fields which have to be defined are `latitude` and `longitude`. The post type can easily be extended adding fields to `places_add_custom_box()` at `functions.php` and modifying template `content-single-place.php`.

## Page templates

- Home: Hides content window, typically used for home pages which directly want to show a map.
- Import Places: Imports a CSV file with format "id;title;latitude;longitude" into post type `place`.
- Export Places: Exports all registers of post type `place` to geojson file `places.tmp.js`. Leaflet uses file `places.js` so periodically (using a cron job or a Wordpress hook) exporting registers and copying the exported file over `places.js` updates the locations on the map.
- DataTables: Shows all registers of post type `place` as a [data table](http://www.datatables.net/).
